[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PLGrudina/GraphQL_API_example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PLGrudina/GraphQL_API_example) 

This is a demo project showing how to build a GraphQL API on the basis of a Play2 framework using Scala and Sangria.

**How to start**

Run an application:

`sbt run`

The application uses H2 database in-memory. Database initialization is provided by Play evolutions. After launch, the application will be available at `localhost:9000`. When you first start you will see a message about the need to execute the sql script. Click `Apply this script now!`
